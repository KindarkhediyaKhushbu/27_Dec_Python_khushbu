#### Understanding the importance of a virtual environment in Python projects. 
1. Install Django: Ensure you have Python installed, then install Django using pip: - pip install django 
2. Create a Django project: Run the following command to start a new Django project: - django-admin startproject project_name 
3. Navigate into the project directory: 
cd project_name 
4. Create a Django app: Run the following command inside the project directory to create an app: 
python manage.py startapp app_name 
5. Register the app in settings: Open settings.py and add the app name to the INSTALLED_APPS list. 
6. Define models: In models.py of the app, create your database models. 
7. Apply migrations: Run 
python manage.py makemigrations app_name 
python manage.py migrate 
8. Create a superuser (optional, for admin access): 
python manage.py createsuperuser 
9. Configure URLs: 
- In project_name/urls.py, include the app's URLs. 
- In app_name, create a urls.py file and define URL patterns. 
10. Run the development server: 
python manage.py runserver 
11. Start development by defining views, templates, and static files as needed.
