##### Using JavaScript for client-side interactivity in Django templates. 
- Using JavaScript for client-side interactivity in Django templates is a common practice to 
enhance the user experience by adding dynamic behavior to web pages. 
###### 1. Embedding JavaScript in Django Templates 
- You can include JavaScript directly in your Django templates using `<script>` tags. 
- Ensure the JavaScript code interacts with HTML elements rendered by the Django 
template. 
###### 2. Using Static Files for JavaScript 
- For better organization, it's recommended to store JavaScript code in separate files and serve 
them using Django's static file system. 
- Create a static/js directory in your app and add your JavaScript files there. 
- Load the static file in the template using the {% load static %} tag. 
###### 3. Interacting with Django Context 
- You can pass data from Django views to JavaScript via template context variables. Use Django's 
- template tags and filters to render variables directly into your JavaScript.
