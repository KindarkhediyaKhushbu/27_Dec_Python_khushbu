#### Overview of Django: Web development framework. 

- Django is a high-level Python web framework designed for rapid development and clean, 
pragmatic design. It emphasizes reusability, modularity, and scalability, allowing developers to 
build robust and efficient web applications quickly. 
##### Features of Django 
###### 1. Ease of Use 
- Django simplifies web development by providing a clear and concise framework for 
developers. 
- Built-in tools like an admin interface and ORM reduce the need for manual coding. 
###### 2. Batteries Included 
- Comes with many built-in features such as authentication, URL routing, templates, and 
form handling. 
- Provides libraries for common web development tasks, such as content management and 
user authentication. 
###### 3. MVC/MVT Architecture 
- Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern: 
- Model: Handles data and database structure. 
- View: Manages business logic and interacts with models. 
- Template: Deals with the presentation layer. 
###### 4. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) 
1. Allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects instead of writing raw 
SQL. 
2. Supports multiple databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle. 
3. Security 
4. Offers robust protection against common vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross
site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking. 
5. Includes built-in mechanisms for managing user authentication securely. 

##### Core Components 
1. Django Apps 
- Django projects are composed of modular apps, each handling a specific functionality. 
- Apps can be reused across different projects. 
2. Middleware 
- Components that process requests and responses globally, such as session management 
and authentication. 
3. Admin Interface 
- Automatically generated admin panel for managing application data. 
4. Django Templates 
- A simple yet powerful templating engine for dynamic HTML generation. 
5. Django REST Framework (DRF) 
- Extends Django for building RESTful APIs. 
Pros of Django 
- Quick development cycles. 
- Highly secure. 
- Encourages clean and maintainable code. 
- Scales well for growing applications. 
##### Cons of Django 
- Can be monolithic for smaller projects. 
- May require some effort to optimize for very high-performance needs. 
Common Use Cases 
- Content management systems (CMS) 
- E-commerce websites 
- Social networking sites 
- RESTful APIs and backend services 
- Data-driven dashboards and web apps
