#### Advantages of Django (e.g., scalability, security).

###### 1. Scalability 
- Efficient Handling of Traffic: Django is designed to handle high traffic volumes and supports 
features like caching, database optimization, and load balancing. 
- Modular Architecture: The framework's modularity allows developers to scale applications 
horizontally (by adding more servers) or vertically (by upgrading resources). 
- Proven at Scale: Used by high-traffic websites such as Instagram, Spotify, and YouTube. 
###### 2. Security 
- Built-in Protections: Django includes tools to protect against common vulnerabilities like: 
- SQL Injection 
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
- Clickjacking 
- Secure Authentication: Provides a robust user authentication and session management system. 
- Regular Updates: Actively maintained with frequent security patches.
