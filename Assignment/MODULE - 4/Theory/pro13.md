#### Understanding the role of manage.py, urls.py, and views.py.

1. manage.py: A command-line tool to manage the Django project, like running the server, 
applying migrations, and creating superusers. 
2. urls.py: Maps URLs to views. The project-level file routes to apps, and app-level files handle 
specific routes for the app. 
3. views.py: Contains logic to process user requests and return responses, like rendering 
templates or displaying data.
