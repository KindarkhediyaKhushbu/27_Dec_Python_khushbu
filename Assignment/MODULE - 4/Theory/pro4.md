##### How to serve static files (like CSS, JavaScript) in Django.

Using JavaScript for client-side interactivity in Django templates is a common practice to
enhance the user experience by adding dynamic behavior to web pages.
###### 1. Embedding JavaScript in Django Templates
- You can include JavaScript directly in your Django templates using `<script>` tags.
- Ensure the JavaScript code interacts with HTML elements rendered by the Django
template.
###### 2. Using Static Files for JavaScript
For better organization, it's recommended to store JavaScript code in separate files and serve
them using Django's static file system.
- Create a static/js directory in your app and add your JavaScript files there.
- Load the static file in the template using the {% load static %} tag.
###### 3. Interacting with Django Context
- You can pass data from Django views to JavaScript via template context variables. Use Django's
template tags and filters to render variables directly into your JavaScript.
###### 4. Using AJAX for Client-Server Communication
- You can use JavaScript libraries like Fetch API or jQuery to send asynchronous requests to
Django views (e.g., for fetching or submitting data).
