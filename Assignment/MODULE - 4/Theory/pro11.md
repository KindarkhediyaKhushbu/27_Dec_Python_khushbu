#### Using venv or virtualenv to create isolated environments. 

- Using venv or virtualenv creates isolated Python environments, preventing dependency 
conflicts between projects. 
- To create a virtual environment with venv: 
python -m venv myenv 
Activate it: 
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate 
- virtualenv works similarly but supports older Python versions and offers extra features. 
- Virtual environments improve project management, enhance security, and ensure 
consistent dependencies.
