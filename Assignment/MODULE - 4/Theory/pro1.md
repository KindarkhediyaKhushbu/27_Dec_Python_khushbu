#### 1.Introduction to embedding HTML within Python using web frameworks like Django or Flask.

- Web frameworks like Django and Flask are essential tools for building modern web
applications. These frameworks facilitate the creation of dynamic web pages by embedding HTML
within Python. This process is achieved through the use of template engines, which bridge the gap
between Python code and HTML.
###### 1. Purpose of Embedding HTML in Python:
-  HTML forms the structure of web pages, while Python handles the logic and data
processing.
- Embedding HTML within Python ensures dynamic content delivery, where the
content of a webpage can change based on user interaction or backend data updates.
###### 2. Web Frameworks and Template Engines:
- Django and Flask are popular Python web frameworks that provide tools for
embedding HTML in a structured and efficient way.
- Both frameworks utilize template engines (Django’s built-in engine or Flask’s
Jinja2) to separate backend logic from the front-end layout.
- Templates allow placeholders for dynamic data, control structures like loops and
conditionals, and inclusion of reusable components.
###### 3. Advantages of Using Frameworks:
- Modularity: Templates help in separating Python code from HTML promoting
better organization and maintainability.
o Reusability: Templates can inherit from a base layout, allowing consistent design
across multiple pages.
- Dynamic Content: Data fetched or computed in Python can be passed to templates,
enabling dynamic updates to web pages.
###### 4. How It Works:
- The backend logic in Python processes user requests, fetches data, and determines
the content to be displayed.
- The framework passes this data to the template engine, which embeds it into
predefined HTML structures.
- The final rendered HTML is sent to the user's browser.
Django and Flask: A Comparison
Django:
- Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern.
- It includes a built-in template engine for rendering HTML files.
- Key features:
- Built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with databases.
- Tight integration between views and templates for ease of use.
##### Flask:
- Flask is more lightweight and flexible, following a Model-View-Controller (MVC)-like
structure.
- It uses the Jinja2 template engine, which offers advanced features like macros and template
inheritance.
- Flask is minimalistic, allowing more customization.
