#### Slicing a list: accessing a range of elements.
-  To access a range of elements in a list, you must slice it. One option is to use the simple slicing operator, i.e. colon : With this operator, you can specify where to start slicing, where to stop slicing, and the step. List slicing produces a new list from an existing one.
- Example:
```py
a = range(100)  
ans = a[:50] 
print(ans)
```
