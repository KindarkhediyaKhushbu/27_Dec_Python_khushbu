#### Creating and accessing elements in a tuple

<b>1. Creating a Tuple</b>
- A tuple is created by placing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses (). You can create a tuple with any number of elements, including zero (empty tuple).

```python
tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')
print(my_tuple) 

# Empty tuple:

empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple) 
```

<b>2. Accessing Elements in a Tuple</b>
You can access individual elements in a tuple by using indexing (0-based indexing, like lists) and slicing.

```python
tuple = (10, 20, 30, 'apple', 'banana')
print(tuple[0]) 
print(tuple[3])  
print(tuple[-1])  
```
