#### Introduction to tuples, immutability.
- Python Tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas. A tuple is similar to a Python list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but the main difference between both is Python tuple is immutable, unlike the Python list which is mutable.

```python
t = (10, 20, 30) 

print(t)
print(type(t))
```
- <b>Immutability of Tuples</b>
Since tuples are immutable, you cannot modify their elements after they are created.


```python

# Tuple definition
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
```
