#### 1.Understanding how to create and access elements in a list.
<b>Creating list:</b>
```python
c = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]
Print(c)
```

<b>Accessing list :</b>
- Elements in a list can be accessed using indexing. Python indexes start at 0, so a[0] will access the first element, while negative indexing allows us to access elements from the end of the list. Like index -1 represents the last elements of list.
- Example:
```python
a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print([0])
print([-1])
```
