#### Standard library modules: math, random.
##### random:

- Python Random module generates random numbers in Python. These are pseudo-random numbers means they are not truly random.

- This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, printing random a value for a list or string, etc. It is an in-built function in Python.

```python
import random
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(random.choice(list1))
```
##### math :
- The math module provides the math functions to deal with basic operations such as addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), and advanced operations like trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.

```python
import math 
r = 4
pie = math.pi
print(pie * r * r)
```
