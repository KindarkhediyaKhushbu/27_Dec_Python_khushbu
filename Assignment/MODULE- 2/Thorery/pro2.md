#### Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing).

<b>Positive indexing :</b>
- Positive indexing starts from 0 and goes up to the length of the list minus one.
- Example:
```python
str = [“khushbu”,”jay”,”janvi”]
print(str[1])
```


<b>Negative indexing :</b>
- Negative indexing starts from -1, which refers to the last element of the list, and goes backward.
- Example :
```python
str = [“khushbu”,”jay”,”janvi”]
print(str[-1])
```
