##### • What is CRUD, and why is it fundamental to backend development?

- CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete 
- the four basic operations performed on data in most applications.

- Create → Add new records (e.g., new user, new order).

- Read → Retrieve data (e.g., fetch user details).

- Update → Modify existing records (e.g., change profile info).

- Delete → Remove records (e.g., delete an order).

- It’s fundamental to backend development because almost every system (e-commerce, banking, social media, etc.) revolves around managing data, and CRUD provides a consistent, structured way to handle it.
