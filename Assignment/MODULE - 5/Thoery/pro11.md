##### Understanding views in DRF: Function-based views vs Class-based views.

###### Django REST Framework (DRF):

- Function-Based Views (FBVs):
Simple Python functions with @api_view. Best for small, quick APIs.

- Class-Based Views (CBVs):
Use classes (APIView, generics, viewsets). Best for large, reusable, scalable APIs.
