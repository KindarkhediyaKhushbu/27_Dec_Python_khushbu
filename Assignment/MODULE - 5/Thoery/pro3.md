##### Why are APIs important in web development?

###### 1. Separation of Frontend & Backend

-  APIs allow the frontend (UI) and backend (server/database) to work independently.

- Example: Your React/Angular/Vue frontend can talk to a Django/Node.js backen via REST APIs.

###### 2. Reusability & Modularity

- APIs expose reusable services like authentication, payments, file uploads, or notifications.

- Instead of writing everything from scratch, developers can integrate existing APIs (Google Maps, Stripe, Twilio).

###### 3. Integration with Third-Party Services

- Websites and apps often rely on external services via APIs:

- Login with Google/Facebook (OAuth APIs)

- Payments via PayPal/Stripe API

- Weather info via OpenWeather API

###### 4. Faster Development

- By reusing APIs, developers save time and focus on unique features instead of reinventing the wheel.

###### 5. Scalability

- APIs make apps more scalable by allowing different services to communicate.

- Example: In microservices architecture, each service has its own API, making it easy to scale individual parts.

###### 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- APIs allow the same backend to serve web apps, mobile apps, IoT devices, etc.

- Example: Instagramâ€™s backend APIs serve both the mobile app and the website.
