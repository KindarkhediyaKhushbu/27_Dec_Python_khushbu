##### Types of APIs: REST, SOAP

###### 1. REST API (Representational State Transfer)

- Architecture style (not a protocol).

- Works mainly over HTTP/HTTPS.

- Uses standard HTTP methods:

- GET → Retrieve data

- POST → Create new data

- PUT/PATCH → Update data

- DELETE → Remove data

###### 2. SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol)

- Protocol-based (strict rules).

- Works over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.

- Always uses XML for request/response.

- Heavier compared to REST (more overhead).
