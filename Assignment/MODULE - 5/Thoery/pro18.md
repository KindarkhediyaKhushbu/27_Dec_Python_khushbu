##### REST principles: statelessness, resource-based URLs, and using HTTP methods for CRUD operations.
Statelessness → Each request is independent; server does not store client state.

Resource-based URLs → Resources are identified with nouns, e.g., /users/1/.

HTTP Methods for CRUD →

GET → Read

POST → Create

PUT/PATCH → Update

DELETE → Delete
