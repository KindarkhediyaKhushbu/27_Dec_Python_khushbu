#### Method overriding: redefining a parent class method in the child class.

- The method in the child class has the same name and signature (parameters) as the method in the parent class.
- It provides a specific implementation that is more suitable for the child class.
T- he method in the child class overrides the inherited method, so when you call that method on an instance of the child class, the child’s method will be executed instead of the parent’s method.
