#### Formatting outputs using f-strings and format().

- Python offers a powerful feature called f-strings (formatted string literals) to simplify string formatting and interpolation. f-strings is introduced in Python 3.6 it provides a concise and intuitive way to embed expressions and variables directly into strings.

```python 
name = "khushbu"
age = 21

print(f"My name is: {name} my age is : {age}")

```
##### format():
- The format() method works in older versions of Python (before 3.6) and is still widely used. It allows you to insert placeholders in a string and later replace them with values using the .format() method.
