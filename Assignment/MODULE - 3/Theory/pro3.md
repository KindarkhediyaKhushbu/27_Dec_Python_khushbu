#### Using the input() function to read user input from the keyboard.
- we use the input() function to take input from the user. Whatever you enter as input, the input function converts it into a string. If you enter an integer value still input() function converts it into a string.

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```
