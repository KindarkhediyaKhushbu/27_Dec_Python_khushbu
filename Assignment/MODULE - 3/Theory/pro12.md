#### Understanding the concepts of classes, objects, attributes, and methods in Python.

##### 1. Class:
- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have. Classes are used to represent real-world entities or abstract concepts.

##### 2. Object:
- An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but when you create an object (an instance of that class), memory is allocated and the object gets its own set of attributes and methods.

##### 3. Attributes:
- Attributes are variables that belong to a class or an object. They store the state of an object or define the properties of a class. Attributes can be defined in the classâ€™s __init__() method (constructor) or directly within the class.

##### 4. Methods:
- Methods are functions that are defined inside a class and can operate on the attributes of the class and its objects. They define the behaviors or actions that an object of the class can perform.
